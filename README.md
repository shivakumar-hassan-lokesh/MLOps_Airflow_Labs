# Airflow Lab 1
End-to-End K-Means ML Workflow Orchestrated with Apache Airflow & Docker

This project implements a complete MLOps workflow using Apache Airflow running inside Docker containers.
The pipeline ingests and preprocesses the Wholesale Customers Dataset, trains a K-Means clustering model, and determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

All tasks are automated through an Airflow DAG.
